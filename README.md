polymer-phase-transition
========================

simulation of the thermal expansion of polymers during phase transitions

Dependencies
------------
- python 2.blah
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy

Goals
-----
 - create curves that fit the data

To Do
-----
 - relative paths for files
 - non constant transition temps to reflect lower levels being suppressed by upper levels

Known Issues
------------
 - curves to not behave like data
 	- lower layers are not currently suppresed by upper layers.
